*the world's smartest robot**

## running
On x86/Nix systems, you only need to run `nix develop .` in the root to generate a suitable compilation environment.

### env

All systems require the following environment variables to run.

```bash
export DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR-TOKEN-HERE
```

*Not actually worldly, smart or a robot (technically).
